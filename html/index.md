# Zisp: 21st-century Scheme-inspired language

Zisp is my experimental toy language inspired by Scheme.  The idea is
that it's a modern "re-imagining" of what Scheme may have been had it
been invented today, and had it been designed with pragmatic use as a
primary concern in its design.

This language doesn't actually exist yet.  You are merely reading the
ramblings of a madman.  A little bit of code is here already though:

Some of the following articles are quite insightful.  Others are VERY
rambly; you've been warned.

Some are outdated with regards to the actual implementation of Zisp,
because writing the code often gives you yet another perspective.
